# CLRS-leetCode

This repository contains my **personal solutions** to LeetCode problems, organized by chapters from the book **"Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS)**.  
The purpose of this repo is to combine **theory from CLRS** with **practical coding practice** on LeetCode to master algorithms and data structures.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Problem statements are **not included** due to copyright.  
> Each problem is summarized in my own words inside the code files.
